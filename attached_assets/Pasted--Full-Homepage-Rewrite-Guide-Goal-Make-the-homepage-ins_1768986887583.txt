🔥 Full Homepage Rewrite Guide

Goal:
Make the homepage instantly understandable, conversion-focused, and SEO-friendly — without sacrificing clarity.

Right now your hero says “Find What Powers Any Website — Instantly.” That’s good, but it lacks clarity about value and differentiation. We’re going to fix that.

💥 1. Updated Hero Section (Headline + Subheadline + CTA)
✅ New Headline (H1)
See What Technology Any Website Uses — With AI-Powered Insights


Why:

Includes the main keyword phrase (“technology any website uses”)

Adds differentiation (AI insights)

🧠 New Subheadline (Supporting clarity & benefits)
Scan any website to detect CMS, hosting, analytics, frameworks, security tools and more — with clear, human-readable AI insights instead of raw lists.


SEO note:
Includes relevant terms (CMS, hosting, analytics, frameworks) that help search engines understand your page.

🚀 Primary CTA Button (Conversion)
Start Free Scan


Under the button (smaller microcopy):

Free to use • No signup required


Why this improves conversion:

“Start Free Scan” is more action-oriented than just “Scan”

Microcopy removes friction for first-time users

📍 2. Hero Supporting Elements

Right under the main form/CTA, add three trust/value points:

Trusted by founders, agencies & marketers • AI-optimized detection • Quick results in seconds


Why:
Short social proof styled elements help reassure users without fake logos or testimonials.

🔎 3. What Problem You Solve (Short Section)

Place this just below the hero:

🔹 Section Title
Stop Guessing What Tools Websites Use

🔹 Supporting Copy
TrueTechFinder shows you exactly what technologies power any website — including CMS, infrastructure, analytics, JavaScript frameworks, security tools and more — without technical complexity.


SEO benefit:
Keyword-rich but natural copy that signals relevance to search engines.

⭐ 4. Built For (Conversion Booster)

Add a 4-column feature box below the problem statement.

Use this exact copy:
Built For
- **Agencies** — audit clients & competitors quickly  
- **Founders** — validate tech decisions with real data  
- **Marketers** — uncover tracking & analytics tools  
- **Developers** — inspect tech stacks instantly


Why:
Users self-segment here — boosting relevancy and conversion.

🔄 5. Key Features (Short & Clear)

Replace the existing “Why TrueTechFinder?” content with benefit-focused points like:

⭐ Key Feature Headline
All the Tech Insights You Need — Organized, Explained, Ready

Feature List (use columns or icons):
- AI-Powered Tech Detection  
- CMS, Hosting & Framework Identification  
- Side-by-Side Comparisons  
- Smart Site Previews  
- Export-Ready Results (JSON + PDF soon!)  
- Fast, Clear, Categorized Insights


Conversion tip:
Add a CTA after this block:

Start a Free Scan

📊 6. How It Works (Simplified)

Keep this but make it very scannable:

Suggested Copy
1. Paste a Website URL  
2. See Detected Technologies  
3. Get AI-Driven Insights  
4. Compare & Export Results


Note: Simplifying helps orientation and reduces cognitive load.

🆓 7. Beta / Value Messaging

Your current line “No signup required during beta. Unlimited scans.” can be updated to something more evergreen and clear:

Free to use during beta — no signup required and unlimited scans.


This emphasizes value without sounding temporary.

🧩 8. Homepage SEO Enhancements (Meta)

Make sure your meta title and description reflect the core value.

Meta Title
Website Technology Lookup Tool | AI-Powered Stack Detection – TrueTechFinder

Meta Description
Scan any website to find what technology it uses — CMS, hosting, analytics, frameworks, security and more — with AI-powered insights, comparisons and exportable results.


Why:
Focuses on target keywords while remaining clear to users.

🔍 9. Internal Linking (SEO + Engagement)

Add strategic internal links on the homepage to:

Scan page

Compare page

Pricing page

Blog home

Your best blog posts once they’re live

Example placement:

Ready to learn more? Visit the [Blog](/blog) or compare two websites on our [Compare page](/compare).


This helps Google understand site structure and keeps users exploring.

📱 10. Mobile UX Priorities

Make sure:

The headline doesn’t wrap awkwardly

The primary CTA is above the fold on phones

Supporting trust signals are visible without scrolling

🧪 11. Tracking & Analytics (if not done)

Ensure you have:

Google Analytics installed

Google Search Console linked (you’ve set this up earlier)

Click tracking on the primary Scan CTA

This lets you measure impact quickly after publishing.
