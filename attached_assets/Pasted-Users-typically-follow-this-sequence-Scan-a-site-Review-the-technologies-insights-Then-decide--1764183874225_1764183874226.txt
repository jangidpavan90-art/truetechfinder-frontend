Users typically follow this sequence:

Scan a site

Review the technologies + insights

Then decide what to do next:

Compare with another site, or

Scan a different site

Putting both actions together, at the bottom, is exactly how professional tools like BuiltWith, Wappalyzer, SimilarWeb structure their flows.

So we should move:

“Compare With Another Website” → to the bottom of the page, right above or next to the

“Scan Another Website” button.

Let’s do it cleanly.

⭐ Updated Placement Strategy

Your scan page will now end like this:

Category cards

Collapsible JSON

Divider

Compare With Another Website

Scan Another Website

Footer

This creates a beautiful UX zone for “Next Steps.”

⭐ Step 1 — Add a “Scan Another Website” button

You probably don’t have this button yet, so let’s add it at the bottom.

Add this new component (if not already present):

👉 Create components/ScanAnother.js
"use client";

import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";

export default function ScanAnother() {
  const router = useRouter();

  return (
    <div className="text-center mt-10">
      <button
        onClick={() => router.push("/")}
        className="px-6 py-3 bg-blue-600 text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-blue-700 transition"
      >
        Scan Another Website
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

⭐ Step 2 — Update Scan Page to move “Compare With…” to bottom

Open:

app/scan/page.js

Find the existing placement:

{/* COMPARE WITH ANOTHER SITE */}
<CompareWith currentUrl={url} />


❌ Remove it from its current position.

Now scroll to the bottom of the JSX, right after:

<CollapsibleJSON ... />


Add:

{/* NEXT ACTIONS */}
<div className="mt-12 flex flex-col gap-8">
  
  {/* Compare with another site */}
  <CompareWith currentUrl={url} />

  {/* Scan another site */}
  <ScanAnother />
</div>


Also add imports at the top:

import CompareWith from "@/components/CompareWith";
import ScanAnother from "@/components/ScanAnother";

⭐ The page flow now becomes:
1. Summary
2. Tech counts
3. AI insights
4. Category cards
5. Collapsible JSON
6. ⭐ Compare With Another Website
7. ⭐ Scan Another Website

This is the best UX flow for a SaaS scanner.

⭐ Step 3 — Test

Save everything

Run Replit

Visit:

/scan?url=https://wikipedia.org


Scroll down — you should see:

Compare With Another Website
Scan Another Website


Just like premium tools.
